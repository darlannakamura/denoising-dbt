# Denoising DBT Projections using Convolutional Neural Networks

This is the source code of the paper **Denoising Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Projections using
Convolutional Neural Networks** in proceedings at the [SPIE](https://spie.org) 2020 conference.
This paper compares several methods, deep learning and traditional methods for denosing DBT images.


## Setup

Considering that you have Python installed and your OS is Linux based, follow the steps bellow.

A good practice is creating a virtual environment to run this project. You can do this running the following command in the project directory:

    python -m venv $PWD/venv

To activate the virtual environment, run:

    venv/bin/activate

Now, run the command bellow to install the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
